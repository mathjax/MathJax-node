If you intend to use MathJax-node's ability to create PNG images, you
should install [batik 1.7](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/download.html)
in this directory.  Just download batik version 1.7 and unpack it here. You need
`batik-rasterizer.jar` and the `lib` directory to be in the top level
of this directory.
