If you intend to use MathJax-node's ability to create PNG images, you
should install [batik](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/download.html)
in this directory.  Just download it and unpack it here.  You need
`batik-rasterizer.jar` and the `lib` directory to be in the top level
of this directory.
